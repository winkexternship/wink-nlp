documents.b = `Top 5 tips for writing:

I love writing. Writing is a skill to be developed, a process of constant learning. That's why I always put myself in a position of apprentice. This way I can always learn and improve my writing.

Writing is an art, so there is no formula to be followed. I don't want to make any rules, only advice to improve your writing.

I don't believe that knowledge is an individual's capital, but something to be shared. Pick up what is useful, discard what is useless, and I will be happy to help you.

1. Use a Story as a Draft
Create a story as a draft with two things: a list of texts you will write, and random ideas about anything. It is only a draft, which will never be published, but it serves to guide you, so you won't forget the ideas that come to mind. Always write down your ideas, so you don't forget them.

2. Don't Plan to Write a Text for a Long Time
If you ask me at what point one should start a new text, I would say: think of an idea, but start soon. My article on Aleister Crowley took a few months to write because I kept thinking: “Whenever I feel ready, I'll start writing it. After months, it hadn't even started, because I never felt ready.
Then I realized that I never felt entirely ready for anything I did, so I decided to start the article anyway. To my surprise, on the same day, I wrote half of the article.

3. You Need to Know What You Are Going to Write About, but You Don't Need to Know How It Will End
When I start writing a text, I have the subject in mind, but I have no idea how it will look like when it is finished. Many ideas come to me along the way. That is why I write the title and subtitle last, as they are what summarize the entire text.

4. Writing is Not Always Pleasant
I don't always enjoy writing. It is often a difficult task, and I cannot explain why. It's just the way it is. It's a struggle with words. Some days are productive, others not so much. However, it is rewarding to see my work done, and done well.

5. Vitally, get your art out into the world. Write, paint, photograph and create.
Writing is like moulding clay, you need to get your work onto the page (virtual or otherwise) so you have something to rewrite. Writing is all in the rewriting and polishing.`;

documents.c = `When will COVID end in India? Experts explain what's in store after Omicron

In India, the COVID might enter the endemic stage soon unless a new variant surprises us, a noted virologist commented. He further added, the possibility of endemic cannot be counted unless the country shows low and stable numbers of COVID-19 cases for four straight weeks. This comes at a time when the third wave of COVID-19 is plateauing in India. For the last nine days, the daily COVID tally has remained below 1 lakh.

“When case numbers in a community are plotted on graphs, the pattern of rise, peak and fall represent epidemic (or outbreak) and case numbers as a horizontal steady state are called endemic. When an epidemic pattern repeats, we call each a wave," Dr T Jacob John, former director of the Indian Council for Medical Research's Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, told news agency PTI

"So unless we see four weeks of low and stable numbers with only minor fluctuations, we cannot call the valley as endemic just as yet," John asserted.

Is India entering the endemic stage? Noting that the Omicron receding fast in India, John said that the endemic stage might come soon unless another variant surprises us. "Omicron wave is receding so fast that in a few more days we may reach the valley, but we will wait for four weeks to be sure of endemic prevalence," he said. "My intelligent guess: we will slip into an endemic phase for many months without any more waves with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta or Omicron. It will be most unlikely that yet another variant that will spread faster than Omicron and more efficient in immune evasion that Delta or Omicron will emerge," John said. "However, just as Omicron surprised us, another weird variant could surprise us yet again," he warned.

John also said that during the endemic phase, some will be infected, sick, hospitalised and even die. We will have to learn to live with COVID

However, another expert pointed out that it is of limited relevance from the perspective of the general public whether COVID-19 has become endemic in India or not. He further asserted that we will have to learn to live with the virus. “This is a discourse which will continue for a while. From the perspective of interventional epidemiology, which focuses on operational solutions, India soon, in a few weeks, would be at a stage where everything should be fully open," Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, a physician-epidemiologist and executive director of the Delhi-based Foundation for People-Centric Health Systems told PTI. "That point onwards, people would have to adapt to the new way of living with the virus depending upon their level of risk. But because of COVID-19 nothing should be stopped," Lahariya added.

Lahariya said pandemics end with a socio-political consensus to arrive at an agreement of what a society would like to call endemic.

"What is important to remember is that pandemics start with a pathogen. In this case, due to the virus. They end with a socio-political consensus to arrive at an agreement of what a society would like to call endemic. Therefore, when a setting reaches endemicity is not going to be a binary of pandemic or endemic," he said.`;

documents.d = `Russia-Ukraine crisis: How likely is it to escalate into broader war?

Because let's face it, that is what a lot of people are understandably asking and thinking in the light of the Kremlin's recent actions over Ukraine - actions and statements that have triggered a deluge of denouncements and sanctions from the West. No. As bad as the situation on the Russia-Ukraine border is right now, it does not currently involve a direct military confrontation between Nato and Russia.

In fact, when the US and Britain watched in dismay as Russia built up a force capable of invading Ukraine, they swiftly pulled out their small number of military trainers and advisers. "That's a world war when Americans and Russians start shooting at each other," said US President Joe Biden earlier this month, vowing he would not deploy American troops to Ukraine under any circumstances. But western leaders still fear Russia could be poised to make a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

How worried you should be still depends on a number of factors - like who you are, where you are, and what Russia does next. If you are a frontline Ukrainian soldier in eastern Ukraine then clearly the situation is extremely dangerous. And for millions of Ukrainian people the fears over how the crisis will impact their daily lives is ever present. Only President Putin and his trusted inner circle know how deep into Ukraine he intends to send his troops. As long as Russia's potential invasion force remains massed on the borders then even the bustling Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and other cities, will not be safe from attack.

But the absolute red line for Nato and the West is if Russia threatens a Nato member state. Under Nato's Article 5 the entire western military alliance is obliged to come to the defence of any member state that comes under attack. Ukraine is not a member of Nato, although it has said it wants to join - something President Putin is determined to block. Eastern European countries like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland - once part of Moscow's orbit in Soviet times - are all now Nato members. They are feeling distinctly nervous that Russian forces might not stop at Ukraine and instead use some pretext to "come to the aid" of the ethnic Russian minorities in the Baltics and invade. Hence Nato has recently sent reinforcements to bolster its Eastern European members as a deterrent.

So how worried should you be? As long as there is no direct conflict between Russia and Nato then there is no reason for this crisis, bad as it is, to descend into a full-scale world war. Let's not forget that Russia and America have, between them, over 8,000 deployable nuclear warheads so the stakes here are stratospherically high. The old Cold War maxim of "MAD" - Mutually Assured Destruction - still applies. "Putin," said a senior British military source on Tuesday, "is not about to attack Nato. He just wants to turn Ukraine into a vassal state like Belarus." But the wild card here is the state of Putin's mind. Often described as coldly calculating, like the chess player and judo fighter that he is, his speech on Monday resembled more that of an angry dictator than a shrewd strategist. Calling Nato "evil", he effectively told Ukraine it had no right to exist as a sovereign nation independent from Russia. This is worrying.

Britain is not the only country to be punishing Russia with sanctions - the US has gone further and Germany, for example, has now postponed giving the green light to the massive Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia - but the UK is in the forefront of pushing for penalties. Russia will certainly retaliate in some form. Western businesses in Russia will likely suffer but it could go further, much further, if Putin decides. "Revenge" could take the form of cyber attacks - something the National Cyber Security Centre has already warned about. Often hard to attribute, these could target banks, businesses, individuals and even critical national infrastructure.

The problem now is that after years of declining relations with Moscow, including over the poisoning of Russian dissidents on UK soil, there is almost zero mutual trust remaining between Russia and the West. And that is a dangerous backdrop against which to have a blazing public row over who is to blame for the ongoing crisis in Ukraine.`;

documents.e = `Chinese 'Space Cleaner' Spotted Grabbing and Throwing Away Old Satellite

Something out of a Star Wars movie occurred in Earth's orbit last month.

A Chinese satellite was spotted in late January grabbing another long-dead satellite and days later throwing it into a “graveyard” orbit 300 km away, where objects are less likely to hit spacecraft.

These rare events were presented by Brien Flewelling in a webinar hosted by the Centre of Strategic and International Studies and Secure World Foundation last month. Flewelling is the chief space situational awareness architect of ExoAnalytic Solutions, a private US company that tracks the position of satellites using a large global network of optic telescopes.

The Chinese SJ-21 satellite was seen on January 22 changing its usual place in the sky to approach decommissioned satellite Compass-G2. A few days later, SJ-21 attached to G2, altering its orbit.

Chinese officials haven't yet confirmed that the apparent space tug occurred.

Over the course of the next few days, the spacecraft couple started dancing westward, ExoAnalytic's video footage showed. By January 26, the two satellites separated, and G2 was kicked into oblivion.

The Compass-G2, or BeiDou-2 G2, is a spacecraft from China's BeiDou-2 Navigation Satellite System that failed shortly after launching in 2009. For more than 10 years, the metal carcass has been wandering around Earth alongside millions of other pieces of space trash.

SJ-21, which launched in October 2021, has now returned to a geostationary orbit (GEO) just above the Congo Basin. GEO happens when a satellite orbits Earth over the equator at the same speed the planet rotates.

From the Earth's point of view, satellites in GEO seem to be standing still, barring a wobble or two. This type of orbit is sometimes called a Clarke orbit, named after British sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke. He popularized the idea of GEO in a 1945 paper promising to revolutionize telecommunications.

Less than two decades later, the first geostationary satellite was launched.`;

The kids are, as grandma says, more like "dressed-up midgets" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch.
